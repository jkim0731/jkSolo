function merge_error_saved(date)
% Sometimes, because of bControl error, there are more than 2 different 
% saved files, usually having different alphabet at the end of the file 
% name (e.g., 1111111a.mat, 11111111b.mat, ...)
% This function is designed to merge those saved files into one for further
% analysis. The resulting file will have alphabet 'x' at the end (e.g.,
% 1111111x.mat). Practically, there will be 2-3 files max. 

% This also fixes another error occuring sometimes: n_done_trials mismatch
% Therefore, it is recommended to run this function for every saved files
% at least once, even if there was no error during the experiment.
% SidesSection_previous_sides are always having +1 or +2 indices, which
% makes it erroneous for merging, and this function makes the number of
% components same.
%
% Input argument date defines saved date, shown at the file name.
% 
% Make every data into #trials X 1 matrix. As a convention. _previous_
% parameters should be transposed. Make every data in this convention in
% the future.

%% IMPORTANT! FOR angdist protocol. 2017/03/16 JK
% MotorsSection_previous_* will be different before AH0653 (~2017/03/30) and
% after that. Should have considered for trial #1 before. 
% current remedy: when saving *_x.mat, add one at the beginning, with just
% the first value. 

%% Treatment of fields having 'previous' in it
% For some reason (that I don't know), *_hit_history, SidesSection_previous_* (and
% MotorsSection_previous_* in case of angdist protocol) are saved in
% "saved", not in "saved_history". It is more convenient when these fields
% are saved in "saved_history", so I'll copy them. The resulting file will
% have the full-length stitched *_previous_* only in "saved_history", and
% "saved" will be same as the LAST "saved" one. These data will be in
% double format instead of cell. If you want everything in cell format for
% consistency, use num2cell at the end.

% SO BE CAREFUL WHEN BUILDING THE BEHAVIOR ARRAY

%% merging
% The first trial is a kind of dummy.
% But we need to keep them to match the trial numbers.
% Depending on the reason and timing of RPbox error, number of recorded
% history might differ between fields in saved_history. The importance
% of fields vary, so here we'll take the most conservative method -
% among those fields having more than 0 length, take the lowest length 
% and just save that length. 
% To compare trial numbers with others, this will save where the stitching
% occurred (variable named "n_done_trials"). So far, whisker video 
% and tpm are recording from trial #2, so at stitching, the first trial of
% following sessions (saved files) will be deleted. This is to make the
% resulting file look like from one session, just as same as other
% sessions.
